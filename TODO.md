# Todo

- new arch
  - single vertically scaling server with api + worlds
  - website that speaks to api
  - hosting
    - fly.io tiny website ~$5/mo
    - fly.io perf-1 2GB-8GB ~$30-60/mo
    - R2 or Bunny storage
- when moving, don't instance so layers work and you can stack same-models
- fix dnd uploads for multiplayer etc
- edit window
  - change model file
  - toggle physics
  - toggle animation autoplay
  - toggle preload (load before spawn, defaults to false)
- consolidate on naming "actions" and "action wheel"
- remove create action? everything starts from drag and dropping a thing
- how can we allow drag and drop UX but still prevent people dropping dumb huge shit
- chat
  - world tab for local world chat
  - global tab for global chat (across all worlds) (NOTE: term global makes sense sense, globe=world)
  - console tab for script errors and stuff
    - gl-stats could be here etc
    - commands like `stats` show triangles, textures etc
    - commands to search, find, move, remove things etc
  - virtualized scroll window eg react-window but dynamic
- spawn
  - world settings could just have a "set current location as spawn"
- re-auth
  - support disconnect/connect without reloading
- vrm
  - set avatar + play motions + emotes
- voicechat
  - button near chat window tabs?
- backpack
  - ...
- forging
  - ...
- inspect window
  - model stats!
  - model preview + wireframe
  - nft link / proof
  - nft mint button + supply/price etc
- model not found VS crash
  - show different error model for "not found" or "crashed"
- lod suffix
  - example mesh names (all with same parent)
    - tree
    - tree_lod50
    - tree_lod100
  - when <50 meters away `tree` is used
  - when >=50 <100 `tree_lod50` is used
  - when >=100 `tree_lod100` is used
  - take scale into account
    - eg if scale 0.5,0.6,0.7
    - max is 0.7 (could also use avg)
    - 0.7 \* lod distance = real distance to swap lod
